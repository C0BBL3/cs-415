To (re)compile each program
    - cd partX
    - make clean; make;

To run each program
    - cd partX
    - ./bank input.txt

Note you have to run it in the directory because of the output files needing the output folder which is not in the main project3 directory

To run the 10000 test
    - cd part3/4
    - ./run_multiple_times

Note part4 seg faults most of the time but if it does just keep running it until it doesnt seg fault. It will work fine.
